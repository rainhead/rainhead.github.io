  Status.
  <ul>
    <li>At its current stage, this document is for externalizing some of my beliefs, and organizing the work of making them more precise.</li>
    <li>Many of the terms below are vague or ambiguous, please bear with me - or <a href="https://github.com/rainhead/rainhead.github.io/issues/new">ask for clarification</a>.</li>
    <li>One of the best things to do next is to list positive examples of these things.</li>
  </ul>

  Definitions.
  <ul>
    <li>We're concerned here with specific, situated information systems. Think of a website, not a framework; a Slack channel, not Slack.</li>
    <li>We understand records as facts from relational databases: atomic descriptions of the world.</li>
    <li>Design is an activity where we create new language for future expression.</li>
    <li>Building is an activity where we give <em>life</em> to some language.</li>
  </ul>

  Ends.
  <ul>
    <li>People with minimal training should be able to make tools for collaborative expression.</li>
    <li>Designing an information system should be the same as building it.</li>
    <li>It should be easy to adapt tools to local values and requirements.</li>
    <li>To liberate ordinary people and organizations from their IT departments.</li>
    <li>To free computer scientists from "plumbing" work.</li>
    <li>Collaboration and experimentation should be possible in a "live" enrivonment.</li>
  </ul>

  Means.
  <ul>
    <li>Our tools should help us think about the consequences of design choices.</li>
    <li>We should be comfortable making mistakes (forgiveness).</li>
    <li>Our tools should accomodate subtle variations ('special cases').</li>
    <li>Our tools should sit with us as we resolve conflicts.</li>
    <li>The toolbox should be big enough that the purpose and power of any tool is clear, but small enough that it can be mastered in one's spare time.</li>
  </ul>

  Principles.
  <ul>
    <li>Information systems represent the world, and are also part of it. We think and talk through them, but we also act.</li>
    <li>How information propagates through a system is a core design domain.</li>
    <li>All ground truth is human speech. From the perspective of any system, they are observations of the outside world.</li>
    <li>Context is a rich resource, honor it.</li>
    <li>Embrace the ambiguity of new ideas, new forms: let them take names when they are ready.</li>
    <li>Embrace the rigor of well-established forms.</li>
    <li>Reflect an intuitive and causal sense of history.</li>
    <li>Every system is open. Retain these principles when composing systems.</li>
    <li>All records are immutable, and typically refer to other records.</li>
  </ul>

  Cases.
  <ul>
    <li>UI patterns should be first-class objects, and should allow for lightweight adaptation.</li>
    <li>Because we retain input in its entirety, it should be possible to backfill any new analytic.</li>
    <li>Renaming a model object should be trivial.</li>
    <li>Disambiguating two cases of some model should also be as easy as possible.</li>
    <li>Model user flows to reason about possible histories and requests.</li>
    <li>Model a user flow before writing any implicated web pages.</li>
  </ul>

  Strategy.
  <ul>
    <li>Make it okay to be wrong a lot.</li>
    <li>Find cheap ways to validate ideas within the actually existing world.</li>
    <li>Create value early. Where successful, these ideas will allow us to provide more value faster and more cheaply than others.</li>
    <li>Economize our commitments to the outside world. Stay nimble, and invest in things that will continue to teach us as our ideas evolve.</li>
  </ul>
